# preference-sort
Let the user decide how to sort a list. (2016)

I've always found it hard to order long lists of items by preference/priority (e.g. "pick your favorite from these 25 items"). 

What I end up doing is doing a tournament-style selection so I only have to pick between two items at a time. 

I decided that it would be cool to automate the process, and thus, this project was born.
