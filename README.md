# Preference Sort (2016)

Let the user decide how to sort a list. 

I've always found it hard to order long lists of items by preference/priority (e.g. "pick your favorite from these 25 items"). 

What I end up doing is doing a tournament-style selection so I only have to pick between two items at a time. 

I decided that it would be cool to automate the process, and thus, this project was born.

This project also serves as a way for me to try out various tools like Travis-CI, Code Climate and Codecov and see how they work.
